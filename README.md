JavaScript Mastery Lab 🧪

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This project is a curated collection of exercises and mini-projects designed to master modern JavaScript (ES6+) fundamentals, ranging from basic syntax to complex asynchronous workflows.

🚀 Key Learning Milestones

This repository is organized by core concepts, demonstrating a progression from synchronous logic to asynchronous data handling.

1. Modern Syntax & Logic
* Variable Scoping: Implementing let and const to manage block-level scoping and prevent side effects.

* Advanced Loops: Utilizing for...in for object enumeration and for...of for iterating over collections (Arrays/Strings).

* Logical Short-circuiting: Using && (AND) for conditional execution and || (OR) for setting fallback/default values.

2. Data Manipulation
* Destructuring Assignment: * Arrays: Extracting values from complex lists (e.g., Inventory Management System).

* Nested Objects: Deep-diving into multi-layered objects to extract specific properties in a single line.

3. Asynchronous JavaScript (The "Auth Simulation" Project)
A practical implementation of a mock authentication flow using:
* Promises: Manually constructing resolve/reject logic to handle data fetching.

* Async/Await: Orchestrating sequential dependent calls (Email ➔ UserID ➔ Roles).

* Error Handling: Implementing robust try/catch blocks to manage API-like failures.

🛠️ How to run the examples
Clone the repository with SSH:

git clone git@github.com:your-username/javascript-mastery-lab.git

Navigate to the directory:
cd javascript-mastery-lab

Run any file using Node.js:
node auth-simulation.js

📈 Evolution

This repository is constantly updated as I explore more advanced topics like Functional Programming (Map, Filter, Reduce) and Design Patterns.
